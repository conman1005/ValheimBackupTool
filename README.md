# ValheimBackupTool
## About
**ValheimBackupTool** is a Windows Forms Application that makes it easy to backup and manage backups of Characters and Worlds for the game Valheim.

I created this app because when I was playing Valheim, I would frequently go into the save folders to make backups on my saves. So I thought to myself that I could make a tool for that.

To my knowledge, there was no app that did this available online when I developed this in 2024.
