# ValheimBackupTool
## About
**ValheimBackupTool** is a Windows Forms Application developed in C# that makes it easy to backup and manage backups of Characters and Worlds for the game Valheim.

I created this app because when I was playing Valheim, I would frequently go into the save folders to make backups on my saves. So I thought to myself that I could make a tool for that.

To my knowledge, there was no app that did this available online when I developed this in 2024.

## Interface
### Main Menu
The Main Menu is split into two sections; Left is for Backups on **Characters**, and Right is for Backups of **Worlds**.

### Backing Up
Backing up works by selecting a **Character** or **World** from their lists, then clicking the corrosponding "Back Up" button will create a backup save.

In hindsight, I should have implemented this to work with only one "Back Up" button to avoid user confusion on which button to press.

### Manage Character Saves
Upon chicking "Back Up" under the **Backup Character** section, you arrive in the **Manage Backups** screen for **Characters**. From there you can load or delete a previous **Character** backup.

### Manage World Saves
Upon chicking "Back Up" under the **Backup World** section, you arrive in the **Manage Backups** screen for **Worlds**. From there you can load or delete a previous **World** backup.
